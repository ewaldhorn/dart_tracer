# dart_tracer

Simple Dart raytracer.  Heavily based on the awesome work known as [TinyRayTracer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer).

I followed the excellent tutorial by [ssloy](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer/wiki) to refresh my knowledge of ray tracing.

## Please Note

Where the opening of a file in the default viewer is concerned, this code is written for a *Mac*.  I am happy to add more options, but, for now, just be aware of that.
