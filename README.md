# dart_tracer

Simple Dart raytracer.  Heavily based on the awesome work known as [TinyRayTracer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer).

I followed the excellent tutorial by [Dmitry V. Sokolov aka ssloy](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer/wiki) to refresh my knowledge of ray tracing.

## Disclaimer

I have been doing a lot of Python and JavaScript of late, so my Dart is very rusty! None of this is best practice or even good code. The fact that it runs in incidental.  If it works for you, awesome. If it doesn't, sorry!

### Please Note

Where the opening of a file in the default viewer is concerned, this code is written for a *Mac*.  I am happy to add more options, but, for now, just be aware of that.
